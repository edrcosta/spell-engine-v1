# Pixer Simple Game engine 

this is a simple 2d canvas game engine made for fun

the objective is learn about game engines and make some simple games 

## install 

This is a simple js application just open index.html into a modern browser

## Build Requirements 

npm 6.14.4
node v10.20.1
grunt https://gruntjs.com/

## Building 

`npm intall`
`grunt build`

## How it works and why? 

1 - Bitmap are loaded in memory
    
    bitmap as the name say is jut a "bit map of your screen

    at start i think in really use bitmap patterns and i will (some day i hope), but we are in a browser so any "css valid color" is accepted #000 or white.. but is very hard to visualize an array as 

    [
        []
    ]

    

2 - 

### Game loop 

the easy way to create a animation is change frame by frame as recomended by canvas API documentation:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_animations

### bitmaping rendering
